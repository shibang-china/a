They are also commonly found in various markets and construction sites as well. They provide basic material for road and building construction. They are highly popular in the mining industry due to their ability to subdivide large blocks into smaller pieces and achieve the desired product size with high efficiency.</p><p>India possesses both types of stone crushing machines, where the stones are reduced in size such as handheld or manually-operated stone crusher machines and those that are automated using newer technologies. The classification of stone crusher machines is based on the differing functionality and mode of operation.</p><p>With stone crushing, the stone is typically fed through a chute to the inside of a crushing chamber. An impact crusher, which uses impact force to break down materials, may be placed in the first stage of a crushing circuit. Jaw crusher, as the name suggests, works on the same principle as the human jaw. It has one stationary jaw (like the upper teeth set) and the other movable (like the lower teeth set), with the material being crushed between them. Roller crushers, on the other hand, are based on cylindrical rolls that crush by compressing and rotating simultaneously.</p><p>One of the best attributes of the Indian stone crusher machine is its versatility in terms of applications, as it can crush a wide range of materials. While maintaining the ability to handle hard rock and various recycling materials, we offer advanced hydraulic systems for over-loading protection and adjustment, making them highly energy-efficient as well.</p><p>Many stone crusher machines are available in various capacities, ranging from 30 to 500 tons per hour. With the increase in production and larger reduction ratios, the demand for larger and more productive machines is increasing in mines and quarries.</p><p>India has vast reserves of various stones - including granite, marble, sandstone, limestone, slate, and quartzite - spread out across the country. India is also one of the largest producers of stone, contributing to about 15% of the world's total production. The mining industry in India is a major economic activity which contributes significantly to the country's GDP.</p><p>Stone crushers are key equipment for crushing, grinding, and quarrying operations. With proper selection of crushing chamber and eccentricity, a wide range of models and configurations can be catered to meet the requirements of different plants and materials.</p><p>India is the largest producer of stone aggregates, accounting for more than half of the total production.
