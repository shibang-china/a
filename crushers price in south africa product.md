And this kind of ore crusher for sale is becoming more and more important in many industries.</p><p>cone crusher material Cone Crusher Spare Parts: This kind of crusher machine is mainly composed of frame, transmission shaft, eccentric sleeve, spherical bearing, crushing cone, adjusting device, adjusting sleeve, spring and discharging port. In order to give customers a better understanding of the crusher, Aimix will describe the detailed informations of the following parts .</p><p>Firstly, the main frame of the rock crushing plant. The main frame consists of the upper frame part and the lower frame part. The two parts are connected by hydraulic cylinder. The upper shelf is a welding piece, and the upper side of the shelf is welded with a wear-resistant copper plate. And the lower frame is a whole cast steel.</p><p>Secondly, the rock crushing equipment has large production capacity. The cone crusher has higher speed stroke, so the rated power of the cone crusher is increased, and the processing capacity of the equipment is greatly improved.</p><p>Lastly, the hydraulic cone crusher adopts hydraulic adjustment, which greatly simplifies the adjustment of the discharge port. Besides, the hydraulic cone crusher adopts automatic control system to control the discharging opening. Due to its high crushing ratio, high efficiency, low energy consumption, uniform product size, cone crusher machine is usually used for medium crushing and fine crushing.</p><p>The cone crushers can crush the hard and medium hard ores and rocks, such as, iron ore, copper ore, limestone, quartz, granite, basalt, diabase. In general, the cone stone crusher Philippines has four different types, ordinary cone crusher, Simmons spring cone crusher, single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher and multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher. The main difference between them is the over-iron protection device, discharge adjustment device, transmission device.</p><p>To sum up, the price of cone crusher is basically in accordance with the above factors.
