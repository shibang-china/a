These stones can be easily extracted from their natural state and processed into high-quality aggregates.</p><p>Secondly, Ethiopia's strategic location enables it to export its products to various markets easily. The country boasts excellent transport and logistics infrastructure, including road networks, railways, and ports, making it a hub for regional trade.</p><p>Furthermore, the stone crushing industry in Ethiopia is highly supported by the government.
