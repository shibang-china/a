They are widely employed for crushing hard and abrasive materials in both the aggregate and mining industries.</p><p>Cone crushers are used predominantly for secondary crushing applications, although they can be used for tertiary or quaternary crushing as well. Cone crushers are often used for this purpose because they are able to crush hard rocks with ease.

It is important to choose a cone crusher that suits your requirements and budget.
