<h3>manufacturer of rotary screen for crushed lime stone</h3><img src='1706753845.jpg' alt=''><p>Crushed limestone is an essential ingredient in construction projects and used to pave roads, make concrete, and even act as the base material for landscaping projects. Thanks to advancements in technology, the manufacturing process of crushed limestone has become more efficient, allowing manufacturers to produce high-quality crushed limestone in large quantities. One crucial piece of equipment that plays a significant role in this process is the rotary screen.</p><p>The rotary screen is a device that is used to segregate different sizes of crushed limestone particles. It consists of a cylindrical, perforated drum made of stainless steel or mild steel. As the drum rotates, the larger limestone particles are retained inside the drum, while the smaller particles pass through the perforations and are discharged onto a conveyor belt. This process ensures that the crushed limestone is separated into different sizes, making it easier to use in various applications.</p><p>One reputable manufacturer of rotary screens for crushed limestone is XYZ Inc.
