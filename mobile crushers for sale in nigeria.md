Available in different types, they are used as primary, secondary, as well as tertiary equipment for particle-on-particle crushing or for improving the quality of end material in terms of shape, size and texture as well as for decreasing the wear and tear of the machine and several other important results.</p><p>Mobile crushers are designed for crushing mineral ores, stones, recycling construction waste and producing aggregate. These equipment reduce large solid masses of raw material into smaller sizes and change the form of waste material so it can be easily disposed or recycled.</p><p>Mobile crushers are often referred to as ‘mobile crushing plants’. They are track-mounted crushing machines which, thanks to their mobility, can maximise productivity and reduce operating costs – while increasing safety and reducing environmental impact. The concept of mobile and semi-mobile crushers has been around for a long time, but for years, many machines were very heavy and moving them required thoughtful planning. However, advancements in technology have paved the way for the emergence of mobile crushers that are compact, easy to transport, and can be assembled and disassembled in a quick and efficient manner.</p><p>In Nigeria, a major asphalt producer is increasing production capacity to cope with growing demand for its materials. Nigeria is developing rapidly and its infrastructural projects are directly contributing to the country's growth.
